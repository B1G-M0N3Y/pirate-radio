# Phase 1: API Routes

The main purpose of this Express application is to be a REST API server. All the
API routes will be served at URL's starting with `/api/`.

Get started by nesting an `api` folder in your `routes` folder. Add an
`index.js` file in the `api` folder with the following contents:

```js
// backend/routes/api/index.js
const router = require('express').Router();

module.exports = router;
```

Import this file into the `routes/index.js` file and connect it to the `router`
there.

```js
// backend/routes/index.js
// ...
const apiRouter = require('./api');

router.use('/api', apiRouter);
// ...
```

All the URLs of the routes in the `api` router will be prefixed with `/api`.

## Test the API Router

Make sure to test this setup by creating the following test route in the
`api` router:

```js
// backend/routes/api/index.js
// ...

router.post('/test', function(req, res) {
  res.json({ requestBody: req.body });
});

// ...
```

A router is created and an API test route is added to the router. The API test
route is accepting requests with the URL path of `/api/test` with the HTTP verb
of `POST`. It sends a JSON response containing whatever is in the body of the
request.

Test this route by navigating to [http://localhost:8000/api/csrf/restore] and
creating a `fetch` request in the browser's DevTools console. Make a request to
`/api/test` with the `POST` method, a body of `{ hello: 'world' }`, a
`"Content-Type"` header, and an `XSRF-TOKEN` header with the value of the
`XSRF-TOKEN` cookie located in your DevTools.

Example fetch request:

```js
fetch('/api/test', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "XSRF-TOKEN": `<value of XSRF-TOKEN cookie>`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ hello: 'world' })
}).then(res => res.json()).then(data => console.log(data));
```

Replace the `<value of XSRF-TOKEN cookie>` with the value of the `XSRF-TOKEN`
cookie. If you don't have the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie anymore, access the
[http://localhost:8000/api/csrf/restore] route to add the cookie back.

After the response returns to the browser, parse the JSON response body and
print it out.

If you get an error, check your backend server logs in the terminal where you
ran `npm start`. Also, check your `fetch` request syntax and your API router
setup.

## Commit your code

Now is a good time to commit and push your code to GitHub!
